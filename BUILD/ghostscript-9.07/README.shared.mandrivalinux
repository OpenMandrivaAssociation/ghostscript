This version of ghostscript support shared modules dynamically loaded
at run time.

There are currently two modules compiled with the Mandriva Linux version of
ghostscript, one to support all X11 devices (typically used by gv) and
another to support the svgalib devices. Look at the
ghostscript-module-??? packages.

There is no configuration needed, just can add (or remove) the package
to add (or remove) the devices concerned in ghostscript.
